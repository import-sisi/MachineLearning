    "The k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm is a type of instance-based learning, which means that it doesn't try to learn a general model, but instead memorizes the entire training dataset. When making a prediction for a new data point, the kNN algorithm finds the k closest points in the training set and uses their labels to make a prediction.\n",
